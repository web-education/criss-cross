Crisscross
===========

The popularity of CSS grids have been increasing steadily over the past years. They bring balance to our pages, and help us build interfaces more quickly. Most grids are one-dimensional: you specify their width and they adapt in height to their content.

Crisscross, however, is two-dimensional: you can specify both width and height, relative to the width of the container.

This allows you to draw responsive squares and rectangles that will always keep the right proportions.
